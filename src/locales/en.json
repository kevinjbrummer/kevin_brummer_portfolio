    "aboutIntro": "Hi there! My name is Kevin Brummer, and I'm a software Engineer based in Osaka, Japan.\n\nI studied computer science in College, and I took some time off to come to Japane to learn about the language and culture.\n\nNot only do I have a passion for all things software and technology, I also hold a special place in my heart for Japan.\n\nSo, in 2022, I decided to combine my passions and become a software engineer in Japan.\n\nI am so lucky to be able to live and work in this beautiful country and I am currently working hard to become an excellent engineer.",
